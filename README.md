# SQL Project: Analysis of Famous Paintings

This project utilizes the Famous Painting dataset sourced from Kaggle. The aim of this project is to derive insights and answer questions about famous paintings using SQL.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Famous Painting dataset from Kaggle. It contains detailed information about various famous paintings.

## Questions

The project addresses 20 questions related to the dataset. Each question is carefully crafted to explore different aspects of the data and derive meaningful insights.

## Solutions

Each question is accompanied by its solution, implemented using SQL. The solutions make use of various SQL concepts such as:

- **Join**: Used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.
- **Subquery**: A query nested inside another query to allow multiple manipulations in a single command.
- **WITH clause (Common Table Expressions - CTEs)**: Used to create a temporary result set that can be referenced within another SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. This is particularly useful for complex queries and improving query readability.
